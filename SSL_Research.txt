SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols that secure communication over the internet by encrypting data between clients and servers. TLS is the modern, more secure successor to SSL, offering stronger encryption and improved performance. HTTPS is more secure than HTTP because it uses SSL/TLS to protect data from eavesdropping, tampering, and impersonation. Without SSL, sensitive information like passwords and payment details can be intercepted, leading to data breaches or man-in-the-middle attacks. Real-world incidents, such as the Equifax breach and various phishing campaigns, have exploited missing or misconfigured SSL to steal data. This highlights the critical importance of properly implementing SSL/TLS in all web applications.
